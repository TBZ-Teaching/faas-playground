# FaaS Playground

A repository for exploring Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) architectures and object-oriented design patterns using Python.

## Purpose

This project is designed to help developers:
- Understand FaaS concepts and implementations
- Practice object-oriented programming principles
- Experiment with serverless function design
- Explore best practices for cloud-native development

## Getting Started

Clone this repository and explore the examples to learn how to structure Python code for serverless environments while maintaining clean OO design patterns.

### Notebook quickstart
- Use Python 3.12 (pinned via `.python-version`).
- Create/activate a venv, then install notebook deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (includes `ipykernel` and `matplotlib`).
- Open `intro.ipynb` in VS Code and run cells top-to-bottom.

## Technologies

- Python 3.x
- FaaS frameworks and tools
- Object-oriented design principles
